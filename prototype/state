Graduation: graduation2.py is satisfying. We just must add the possibility to switch from metres to centimetres until 1cm = 1cm. Scrolling to zoom is satisfying too, but the zoom itself does not meet the goal
Drawing: figure-drawing-app.py is satisfying. There are little problems to fix, but the whole is good.
